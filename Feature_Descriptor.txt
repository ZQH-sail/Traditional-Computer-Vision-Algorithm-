###############################################################################

A feature descriptor is a representation of an image patch, which simplifies the
image by extracting useful information from the image, throwing out the extraneous
information.

Basically it shrinks the acutal image size of width x height x 3 to some vector
of smaller size either in 2 dimension like Convolutional features, or in 1
dimension like HOG features.

For eg, In the case of the HOG (Historgrams of gradients) descriptors. the input
image of size 64 x 128 x 3 is converted to a feature vector of length 3780.
Although the size of the feature vectors can be changed.

The important question here is how to decide which information is useful and which
is extraneous. The type of features aren't good for viewing the image, but are super
useful for performing various computervision based tasks such object detection,
object tracking etc.
