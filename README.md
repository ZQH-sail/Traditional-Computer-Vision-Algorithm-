# Some Traditional algorithms for Object Segmentation

# OverSegmentation using Superpixel Algorithm.  

Getting superpixels of the image using the scikit-image python package
Four methods for Super-pixel Classification:  
a) Felenszwalb's efficient graph based segmentation.         
b) Quickshift image segmentation.                            
c) SLIC -K-Means based image segmentation.                   
d) Compact watershed segmentation of gradient images.

# GrabCut Algorithm 

Extraction of foreground from the background, by taking a rectangle as an input.
